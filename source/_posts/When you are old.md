    <strong>
        When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
        <br/><br/>
        And nodding by the fire,take down this book,
        <br/><br/>
        And slowly read,and dream of the soft look,
		<br/><br/>
        Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep;
		<br/><br/>
        How many loved your moments of glad grace,
		<br/><br/>
        And loved your beauty with love false or true,
		<br/><br/>
        But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
		<br/><br/>
        And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
		<br/><br/>
        And bending down beside the glowing bars,
		<br/><br/>
        Murmur,a little sadly,how love fled,
		<br/><br/>
        And paced upon the mountains overhead,
		<br/><br/>
        And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
